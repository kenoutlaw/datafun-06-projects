### Assignment 6 - Data Analytic Projects
### datafun-06-projects

## Task 1.  Begin with the End in Mind
### Read the exercise. Begin considering what you'd like your second project to focus on / showcase. 

### Use your second project to show all the Python things you know.

### Read from a data file.

### Use statistics - mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance for one or more of the numerical columns.

### Use built-in functions min(), max(), len(), count of records, number of columns, others...

### Create some custom functions, use some branching logic to transform and/or show only a part of the data. 

### Get some of your data into a list. 

### Use filter(), map(), and list comprehensions to clean and transform the data.

### Use pandas
### Use matplotlib hist

### Strive to "tell a story" with data. Use a good title section and useful section headings to professionally present your work. 

## Task 2 - Diamonds Dataset
### Follow the instructions for Exercise 9.16 (starting pg. 350).

### Complete the exercise in a notebook. 

### 1-Load: Get the file, store it in your repo, and load it into a DataFrame. 

### 2-View: Display the first 7 rows and the last 7 rows.

### 3-Describe: Use the DataFrame describe() function to calculate basic descriptive statistics for all numeric columns. 

### 4-Series: Use the Series method describe() to calculate the descriptive stats for all category/text columns.

### 4-Unique: Use the Series method unique() to get unique category values. 

### 5-Histograms: Use the DataFrame's hist() function to create a histogram for each numerical column.

### Required: Use Section headings in your Markdown to make it clear that each of these sections are shown in your notebook. They should be numbered 1-5 and include the keyword shown above.

### Required: Include the title of the notebook, and your name and date at the top.

### Do these consistently. A heading and section titles is required in every notebook. 

## Task 2 Output

### Document your results.

### execute the completed notebook before you commit and push to GitHub. 
 
## Task 3 - Exploratory Data Project

### Use everything you've learned to conduct a unique data exploration project using some information related to your domain. 

### Tell a story with data (do a web search to learn more).
### Use this project to feature all of the key skills learned - creating a professional notebook, writing a good README.md (do a web search). 

### Include challenging Python programming aspects - find a reason to use filter(), map(), and list comprehensions.

### Have fun and make it unique.
 
## Task 3 Output
### Document your results.

### execute the completed notebook before you commit and push to GitHub. 

## Task 4. Push Repo to GitHub
### Use VS Code to commit and sync (push) your repo to GitHub.
